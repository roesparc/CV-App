## React: Components, Props and State

The main goal of this project is to practice React components, props and state by developing a CV app that lets users create a custom CV with the use of input fields.

### Features

- Users can easily edit separate sections of their CV by clicking each section's "Edit" button
- The edit mode lets users see the previously displayed information as values, making it easy to modify and update their CV
- Users can add or delete work experience and education fields, providing flexibility and customization options
- Users can add their own photo
- With a minimalistic and organized design, the app is user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing users to focus on the content of their CV
